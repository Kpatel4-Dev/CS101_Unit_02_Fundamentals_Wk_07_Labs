# Lab 02: Branching and Looping #

In this lab you will practice using branching and looping to create custom functions.
Each of your functions will return something, not print to the console.
This is similar to making a reporter block in Snap! rather than using "say".

## Step 1
Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number. The factorial of a number is the product of all whole numbers from 1 to that number. For example, 4 factorial is 1\*2\*3\*4 = 24. So the call to your method

      factorial(4)

should return 24.

## Step 2
Recreate the ```state_of_water``` function from lab 6 that you made in Snap! but now use Python. The function should take as input a temperature in celsius and return either solid, liquid, or gas. 

## Step 3
Write a function called ```F_to_C``` that takes a temperature in Fahrenheit and converts it to Celsius.

## Step 4
Recreate the ```letter_grade``` function from lab 6 that you made in Snap! but now use Python.
